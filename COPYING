Some of this code was produced with the output from GLEW
(http://glew.sourceforge.net)'s automatic code generation
scripts. These scripts are not part of this distribution, but do not
have as permissive a license. See their site for more information.

The ARGLE project is not affiliated with GLEW or the OpenGL Loader
Generator in any way. It is merely designed to work with them.
